The Claw Talisman is a cornerstone of this build, boosting jump attack damage by 15%, making these attacks devastating for initiating combat and dealing burst damage. Constant, rapid attacks are also crucial to activate the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia, which increases attack power with successive hits, providing a continuous damage boost. High Endurance is essential for managing the increased stamina cost of dual-wielding heavy weapons and wearing heavy armor. The Great-Jar's Arsenal can alleviate equip load concerns, while the Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman offers physical damage reduction for trading blows effectively. The Shard of Alexander will still boost the chosen Ash of War on the main hand. This strategy emphasizes aggressive offense, using jump attacks to initiate, followed by chains of powerstanced attacks to continuously hit enemies, dealing damage, triggering healing, and maximizing the successive attack bonus from the talismans. Maintaining stamina for attacking and dodging is key to this high-pressure playstyle."

    "description": "The single-wielding strategy centers on the Gargoyle's Black Axe's combination of Physical and Holy damage, primarily scaling with Strength and Faith. High investment in these stats maximizes the weapon's damage output, especially when wielded two-handed. The War Cry weapon skill, boosted by the Shard of Alexander talisman, is a key component, increasing attack power and modifying strong attacks into potent charging attacks. High poise armor, such as Lionel's or Bull-Goat sets, is crucial for withstanding enemy attacks during these animations. Further boosting the holy damage output is the Sacred Scorpion Charm, and the Ritual Sword Talisman rewards playing at full health. Gameplay involves leading with incantations like Golden Vow or Flame, Grant Me Strength (if utilizing the off-hand seal), then initiating with War Cry to activate the attack buff and altered R2s. These charging attacks, along with standard R1s, should be used to break enemy stance and deliver heavy blows. The Flask of Wondrous Physick, containing the Holy-Shrouding Cracked Tear and Stonebarb Cracked Tear, further amplifies Holy damage and aids in stance breaking."

This approach is highly aggressive and effective against most enemies and bosses. The combination of the Claw Talisman, Raptor's Black Feathers chest armor, and a high Arcane stat (45-50) makes jump attacks incredibly powerful, especially with the bonus bleed buildup from the second weapon. The Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Lord of Blood's Exultation further amplify damage during rapid attack chains and after triggering bleed. The White Mask and Flame-Shrouding Cracked Tear also enhance damage output. While dual-wielding sacrifices the use of the main hand's Ash of War for a normal attack, the combined damage and bleed buildup from two weapons, particularly during powerstanced jump attacks, more than compensate. The Bloodblade Dance skill from the main hand remains a valuable tool for burst damage and evasive maneuvers, offering a versatile and devastating offensive playstyle. This build thrives on constant pressure and rapid status effect application, making it a fast-paced and high-damage option for PvE, though it may be more susceptible to punishment if not executed carefully in PvP. The main advantage of this strategy lies in its ability to quickly apply bleed to enemies, which can stagger them and open them up for critical hits. The high number of hits from powerstanced attacks combined with the bleed effect and fire damage makes this build very effective against bosses that are susceptible to bleed and can be staggered easily. The playstyle is fast-paced, requiring players to constantly pressure their opponents and manage their stamina effectively. Although this build is very strong in PvE, it may be less effective in PvP due to the risk of being punished for aggressive play and the potential for opponents to avoid the rapid attacks."
