This is an aggressive playstyle that aims to quickly trigger hemorrhage. Use rapid L1 attacks and jump attacks, capitalizing on talismans like the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia for increased damage with successive hits. While having two Reduvias allows for more rapid attacks, the Blood Blade skill's effectiveness doesn't double simply by having two daggers. However, the sheer number of hits when dual wielding will lead to more bleed procs overall. Be mindful of stamina consumption when dual wielding, as the increased attack speed can quickly deplete it.

Parry can be equipped on the Wakizashi for parrying opportunities or Quickstep for evasion. This hybrid approach allows for aggressive melee combat with the katana's reach and moveset, complemented by the utility and low weight of the Wakizashi. Utilize the katana's Ash of War for stance breaks or area control, and consider jump attacks to take advantage of the combined damage of both weapons.

This approach capitalizes on the damage bonus provided by using two Cinquedeas and the high attack speed of dual daggers. The focus is on aggressive melee combat, using standard attacks and jump attacks to inflict damage rapidly. Buffs like Golden Vow and Flame, Grant Me Strength further enhance the physical damage. Bestial Incantations like Beastial Sling can still be integrated into this playstyle for ranged attacks and poise damage.

Focus on charging heavy attacks for high stance damage, which can open enemies for critical strikes or a devastating Bear Witness! attack. According to Reddit, these attacks are swift and hard-hitting. The Ash of War, Bear Witness!, is effective against large enemies and groups because of its wide area of effect and lingering flames. Manage FP carefully to ensure frequent use of Bear Witness! against challenging enemies.

The trade-off is higher FP consumption, which is managed through a higher Mind stat, talismans like the Radagon Icon (providing virtual Dexterity to cap casting speed), and the Cerulean Hidden Tear for temporary infinite FP bursts, crucial for spells like Comet Azur. While Azur's Staff doesn't specifically boost any school of sorcery, its speed benefit is ideal for high-damage spells and for maintaining pressure in both PvE and PvP.

The playstyle is fast-paced, requiring players to constantly pressure their opponents and manage their stamina effectively. Although this build is very strong in PvE, it may be less effective in PvP due to the risk of being punished for aggressive play and the potential for opponents to avoid the rapid attacks.",678,Eleonora's Poleblade,twinblade,,,,678.0,Eleonora's Poleblade,twinblade,915.0,Dragon Communion Seal,sacred_seal,,,,,,,60,Black Knife Gauntlets,arms,61,Black Knife Greaves,legs,1002,Claw Talisman,talisman,992,Rotten Winged Sword Insignia,talisman,1000,Lord of Blood's Exultation,talisman,953,Great-Jar's Arsenal,talisman,1051.0,"Flame, Grant Me Strength",spell,1222.0,Golden Vow,spell,1265.0,Swarm of Flies,spell,1199.0,Bloodflame Blade,spell,,,,,,

The Lord of Blood's Exultation talisman and White Mask provide a large damage boost after triggering bleed, which happens frequently with the whip's rapid attacks. Strategic gameplay involves applying buffs (like Bloodflame Blade or Golden Vow), utilizing the weapon's reach to keep enemies at a distance, and using the Ash of War to deal with specific situations (e.g., Kick against shields, Bloodhound's Step for evasion). The Thorny Cracked Tear and Spiked Cracked Tear in the Flask of Wondrous Physick further enhance successive and charged attack damage, respectively. This build is particularly effective in PvP due to the whip's unparriable nature and its ability to catch enemies who are trying to roll away, YouTube.",784,Hoslow's Petal Whip,whip,,,,915.0,Dragon Communion Seal,sacred_seal,915.0,Dragon Communion Seal,sacred_seal,,,,,,,60,Black Knife Gauntlets,arms,61,Black Knife Greaves,legs,1000,Lord of Blood's Exultation,talisman,980,Warrior Jar Shard,talisman,988,Ritual Sword Talisman,talisman,1018,Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman,talisman,1222.0,Golden Vow,spell,1051.0,"Flame, Grant Me Strength",spell,1265.0,Swarm of Flies,spell,1199.0,Bloodflame Blade,spell,,,,,,

The charged heavy attack is a key component, allowing for a heavy attack into light attack combo that rewards successive attack talismans like Rotten Winged Sword Insignia and Millicent's Prosthesis, YouTube. Using Royal Knight's Resolve on the Urumi and pairing it with the Axe Talisman and Spiked Cracked Tear can lead to massive burst damage from a charged R2, which can be further amplified by the piercing damage bonus from the Spear Talisman (as the R2 thrust deals pierce damage), YouTube. This approach is highly effective in PvP due to the Urumi's deceptive range and the difficulty opponents have in predicting the charged R2 attack, Reddit.
