41,Misericorde build,"The Misericorde build focuses on exploiting the dagger's high critical damage. Parrying attacks with a shield opens enemies for a critical strike.

42,Reduvia build,"This approach uses the Reduvia's speed and bleed effect, along with the Blood Blade skill. Focus on swift strikes to build up bleed. The Blood Blade projectile can initiate bleed buildup from a safe distance or add extra damage and buildup at close range. For enemies resistant to bleed, use the dagger's physical damage output. Maintaining a moderate FP pool for frequent Blood Blade use is important.

43,Dual Reduvia build,"Power stancing two Reduvias significantly increases the speed of bleed buildup, as each strike from both daggers contributes to the bleed meter. This is an aggressive playstyle that aims to quickly trigger hemorrhage. Use rapid L1 attacks and jump attacks, capitalizing on talismans like the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia for increased damage with successive hits. While having two Reduvias allows for more rapid attacks, the Blood Blade skill's effectiveness doesn't double simply by having two daggers. However, the sheer number of hits when dual wielding will lead to more bleed procs overall. Be mindful of stamina consumption when dual wielding, as the increased attack speed can quickly deplete it.

46,Wakizashi & Uchigatana build,"This setup provides the katana power stance moveset, which includes powerful wide swings, while retaining the benefits of the Wakizashi in the left hand. Parry can be equipped on the Wakizashi for parrying opportunities or Quickstep for evasion. This hybrid approach allows for aggressive melee combat with the katana's reach and moveset, complemented by the utility and low weight of the Wakizashi. Utilize the katana's Ash of War for stance breaks or area control, and consider jump attacks to take advantage of the combined damage of both weapons.

Use standard dagger attacks and Quickstep to position for optimal hits and evade incoming attacks. The main damage output comes from the Cinquedea's physical damage, supported by buffs like Golden Vow or Flame, Grant Me Strength, and Flask of Wondrous Physick charges.

Focus on charging heavy attacks for high stance damage, which can open enemies for critical strikes or a devastating Bear Witness! attack. According to Reddit, these attacks are swift and hard-hitting. The Ash of War, Bear Witness!, is effective against large enemies and groups because of its wide area of effect and lingering flames. Manage FP carefully to ensure frequent use of Bear Witness! against challenging enemies. Before engaging, enhance offense and defense with Incantation buffs like Golden Vow or Flame, Grant Me Strength, and Flask of Wondrous Physick charges.

The faster power-stance moveset should be used, particularly against bosses, to quickly break their posture and inflict hemorrhage. Charged heavy attacks, especially when dual wielding, are very effective for damage and stance breaking. Talismans like the Rotten Winged Sword Insignia boost damage with consecutive hits. Use Incantation buffs such as Golden Vow or Flame, Grant Me Strength before critical moments to maximize damage output.

55,Glintstone Staff build,"The Azur's Glintstone Staff build focuses on maximizing casting speed to unleash a constant stream of sorceries, prioritizing offensive pressure over raw damage per cast. The trade-off is higher FP consumption, which is managed through a higher Mind stat, talismans like the Radagon Icon (providing virtual Dexterity to cap casting speed), and the Cerulean Hidden Tear for temporary infinite FP bursts, crucial for spells like Comet Azur. While Azur's Staff doesn't specifically boost any school of sorcery, its speed benefit is ideal for high-damage spells and for maintaining pressure in both PvE and PvP. The Elden Ring Wiki indicates that the 40 virtual Dexterity provided by Azur's staff means you don't need to invest as many points into Dexterity to reach the casting speed cap.",Glintstone Staff,,Chainlink Flail,Finger Seal,,,Azur's Manchettes,Spellblade's Trousers,Graven-Mass Talisman,Godfrey Icon,Magic Scorpion Charm,Radagon Icon,Comet Azur,Carian Slicer,Glintstone Pebble,Glintstone Cometshard,,,Azur's Glintstone Crown,Azur's Glintstone Robe,Ash of War: Cragblade,Ash of War: Wild Strikes

57,Carian Regal Sceptor & Meteorite Staff build,"This approach maximizes sorcery damage and adaptability by pairing the Carian Regal Scepter with a secondary staff. While the Carian Regal Scepter remains the primary casting tool for its superior overall scaling, the off-hand staff provides a passive damage bonus to specific spell types: Carian Sword sorceries with the Carian Glintstone Staff, or Gravity spells with the Meteorite Staff. This allows for a wider array of high-damage spells without needing to constantly re-equip your primary staff, offering greater strategic flexibility in combat.

59,Meteorite Staff & Carian Regal Sceptor build,"In the dual-wielding approach, the upgraded staff in the main hand (like the Carian Regal Scepter) becomes the primary casting tool for its superior scaling, while the Meteorite Staff in the off-hand provides a passive 30% boost to gravity sorceries. This means you'll still get a damage increase when casting gravity spells like Rock Sling, Collapsing Stars, Gravity Well, and Meteorite or Meteorite of Astel, even if not using the Meteorite staff to cast.

This setup shines with the Claw Talisman, which boosts jump attack damage by 15%, making these attacks highly effective for initiating combat and dealing burst damage. The Rotten Winged Sword Insignia further enhances damage output by increasing attack power with successive hits, ideal for the continuous nature of dual-wielding strikes.
